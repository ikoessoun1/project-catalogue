NOTES ON ALGORITHM.

1. WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM
	An algorithm is any well defined computational procedure that takes some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output.
-The statement of the problem determines the input and output.
-The algorithm to be used depends on 
	**number of items**
	**the extent to which the numbers are sorted**
	**possible restrictions on the item values**
	**memory**
	**cpu and gpu**

2. WHAT IS A DATA STRUCTURE
	A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
	-NP-complete problems are problems that have not been completely solved. Such as the travelling salesman.
	-Parallelism is a model for multithreaded algorithms. They take advantage of multiple cores
